My First Love
For memory, love, and farewell.

Why I Appreciate You
I appreciate you—
For the fire in your soul when you chased your dreams,
For the words you spoke when I lost mine.
For folding our world into a tiny house,
Where love echoed in quiet corners.

For making our small house feel like home,
You turned our tiny house into something beautiful,
You cleaned every corner, cared for every detail.
You washed my clothes, and my worries too,
Scrubbed the dirt off my shoes and my shame.
You cooked with your heart—
Not just meals, but moments I still taste.

You spoke your mind even when it trembled,
And you stood firm when I was falling.
In your arms, I always felt I belonged.
And to those who say love is a lie—
They’re wrong. I know it’s real,
I lived it. I loved you. That’s the truth.
You were my first love. My Veronicah and my heart,

Before You and After
Before I met you, I dreamed of you—
Before I saw your face, in dreams you used to reside,
A whispered promise, walking by my side.
You had soft hands, a sharp mind, and a laugh like rain in a dry season.
Forever, I believed, our paths would stay as one,
But life can be unpredictable.
It’s painful to let go of someone you thought you’d never lose.

Funny how life breaks what we thought unbreakable.
You carved your name in my chest,
And even now, it echoes in my silence.

For I thought we were destined to find
An endless journey,
And now, letting go is a pain I couldn't understand.
Now "ex" you are, a word that gives me chills.

I always thought we were a perfect pair,
Like two puzzle pieces made to share.
And though we never said it out loud,
In my heart, I saw you in a white dress,
Smiling — my future, my forever, my bride.

I thought one day, I’d call you my wife,
And you’d call me your husband,
Not in fantasy, but in real, simple life.
That dream didn’t bloom —
It lived deeply in me,
Until life pulled us apart in ways we couldn’t control.

I Waited
You were gone a year,
But in my heart, I waited.
I thought loyalty would bring us back,
Thought love could outlive absence.
But time… time is cruel.

I dreamed of rising from nothing with you,
Of building an empire out of the dust we both came from.
You knew me. You pushed me.
You pushed me, love, to knock on doors, on gates,
Knocking on strangers’ gates,
You stood behind me,
You became my courage when I had none.

Through hardship, we endured, a bond so strong and clear,
I truly thought, my love, that you were always here.

What We Were
We persevered storms together,
I thought you were it—
The one I’d build my forever with.
We were a rhythm, a song,
Now silence swallows our chorus.

We were so truly one, now shattered, torn apart,
Shared everything we had, a broken, empty heart.
We used to hold each other for comfort,
But now that comfort is just a memory,
It's like a ghost whispering in a dark empty room.
Your arms were my perfect resting place,
Now only echoes whisper, on the lonely wind.

What I Regret
I’m sorry if I ever treated you harshly.
There were moments when emotions rose too high,
When I let anger speak instead of love.
You deserved patience, even when things got hard.
You deserved kindness, even when I was tired.
Sometimes, I didn’t know how to handle what I felt.
I didn’t always know how to love gently.

There were times you spoke your mind,
And I stayed silent—
Not because I didn’t care,
But because I didn’t know how to respond.
And I know now, that silence can hurt.

There are things I wish I could go back and change.
But I can’t.
So I carry that pain with me—
Because hurting you was never what I meant to do.

What I Meant
Every promise I made, I made with care,
Held close in my heart, waiting to share.
But time moved fast, and you slipped away.

Each one was real — I meant them, my love.
And for the ones I didn’t keep, I’m sorry.
I hope your next love gives you more than I could,
Not because I didn’t care,
But because I always wanted your happiness.

I’ll carry the memories,
But to heal, I have to let your hand go.

Find someone who truly loves you.
Build a life that lights up your soul.
And if you ever think of me,
Let it bring a quiet smile on your face.

Because I loved you — deeply,
And you were my first.

Goodbye, V & P.
